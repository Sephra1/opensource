# Open Source @ Twilio

## Purpose

This repository is meant to both highlight some of Twilio's open-source projects as well as give you a place to create issues generally involving Twilio and open source.

## New to Open Source?

We understand that entering the world of open source can be intimidating and maybe a bit scary. To help you on your quest into the world of open source we decided to build a mission in our game [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest) to guide you along the path of contributing to your very first open-source project.

As part of the mission you'll learn how to fork a project, set up a local environment, contribute changes and create a pull request, all while contributing to an interactive art project called [Open Pixel Art](https://open-pixel-art.com).

[Start your quest now by downloading TwilioQuest](https://twil.io/hacktoberfest-quest).
